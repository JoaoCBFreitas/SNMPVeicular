These files will contain the FMI(Failure Mode Identifier) and SPN(Suspect Parameter Number) codes and descriptions that are included in the J1939 standard. 

They will be added to the MIB on startup and will be used to diagnose error codes.

These numbers and descriptions were obtained here:

The standard also allows for manufacturer specific SPN to be added.
